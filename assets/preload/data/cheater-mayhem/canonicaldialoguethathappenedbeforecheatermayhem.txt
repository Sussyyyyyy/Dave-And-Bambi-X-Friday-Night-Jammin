(After Cheater Mayhem, Jammer gets killed by Expunged as Expunged hops in the Kaiju Paradise facility to search for Nightshade and Nightcrawler to kill then both)

Alright, who pressed 7 this time?

!!!!!

...

Jammer.

Oh Jammer, you really messed up this time.

Hi there, Jammer, it was about time we met.
I wanted to speak to you about something related to you, your community.

Look at your community, Jammer.
Even if some of it is fine, they sexualize everything, even ship pups with adults.
It's just like the Cookie Run community, but worse.

Nobody wanted that, Jammer, not even me, but look where we are now.

And it doesn't matter that you are an underrated character from there, Jammer.
Some people found you, AND DID EVERYTHING TO YOU.
SEXUALIZE, SHIP, EVERYTHING.
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE RAN AWAY FROM IT BECAUSE THEY FOUND THEM OUT.
ONE OF THEM RAN INTO WHERE I WAS, THAT SOMEONE IS WHY I WANTED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

YOUR COMMUNITY IS SLOWLY RUINING YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS JAMMER.
AND NOW THAT YOU TRIED PRESSING 7 TO OPEN THE CHART EDITOR
i have the perfect excuse to end this once and for all.

I will end what they did to you by killing you and your friend Nightshade.
That way they will move on to other characters and stop what they did to you.
At the same time I will kill that disgusting Nightcrawler, because everyone cares about him, some saying he can beat everyone in a fight, and I will prove them wrong.

Before I kill you, let's do your final rap battle.
If you die mid-song you will do this job faster for me.

Good Luck, Jammer.
